## ![Icon showing coming soon.](./media/hdinsight-release-notes/clock.svg) Coming soon

* The max length of cluster name will be changed to 45 from 59 characters, to improve the security posture of clusters. Customers need to plan for the updates before September 30, 2023.
* Cluster permissions for secure storage  
  * Customers can specify (during cluster creation) whether a secure channel should be used for HDInsight cluster nodes to contact the storage account. 
* In-line quota update.
   * Request quotas increase directly from the My Quota page, which will be a direct API call, which is faster. If the API call fails, then customers need to create a new support request for quota increase.
* HDInsight Cluster Creation with Custom VNets.
  * To improve the overall security posture of the HDInsight clusters, HDInsight clusters using custom VNETs need to ensure that the user needs to have permission for `Microsoft Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action` to perform create operations. Customers would need to plan accordingly as this change would be a mandatory check to avoid cluster creation failures before September 30, 2023. 
* Basic and Standard A-series VMs Retirement.
   * On 31 August 2024, we'll retire Basic and Standard A-series VMs. Before that date, you need to migrate your workloads to Av2-series VMs, which provide more memory per vCPU and faster storage on solid-state drives (SSDs). To avoid service disruptions, [migrate your workloads](https://aka.ms/Av1retirement) from Basic and Standard A-series VMs to Av2-series VMs before 31 August 2024.
* Non-ESP ABFS clusters [Cluster Permissions for Word Readable] 
  * Plan to introduce a change in non-ESP ABFS clusters, which restricts non-Hadoop group users from executing Hadoop commands for storage operations. This change to improve cluster security posture. Customers need to plan for the updates before September 30, 2023.
